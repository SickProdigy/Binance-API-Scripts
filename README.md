# SickProdigy's Binance API Scripts
## Python Based Scripts to gather user data from Binance.us

Hello, I see there aren't a lot of scripts around for binance to excel sheets. Well here is a new updated few.

At first I was testing xlwings, but seems it's broken somwhere in the module.

So I saw pandas had methods to write to excel sheets, so I tested around until I finally got working scripts to pull binance data to excel.
Most of these scripts will have that in mind. You can easily witch to cvs and other scructures. Check pandas module documentation for more examples. Use the search function as the site isn't very intuitive.

Hope this helps someone else. I'll update more as I keep testing along.
