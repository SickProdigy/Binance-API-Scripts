Hello, I see there aren't a lot of scripts around for binance to excel sheets. Well here is a new updated few. 

At first I was testing xlwings, but seems it's broken somwhere in the module.

So I saw pandas had methods to write to excel sheets, so I just stuck with it.

These seem to work.

Hope it helps someone else. I'll update more as I keep testing along.
